  <Description>CoreFreq is a CPU low level monitoring software designed for x86_64-Processors. You can show Package and Core temps, Hot sensor, Vcore, RAM,...&#xD;
You can also toggle SpeedStep, Clock modulation, Turbo boost, C-States demotion, C1E,...&#xD;
It has also a built in stress test and much, much more.&#xD;
Open up a unRAID Terminal and type in 'corefreq-cli' (without quotes), hit "F2" or "SPACE" to open up the menu inside CoreFreq.&#xD;
&#xD;
Please note that not every combination of CPU and motherboard is supported!&#xD;
Intel Systems: It is recommended that you append 'nmi_watchdog=0' (without qutoes) for better accuracy to your syslinux configuration (this is only recommended if you are using it directly on Unraid with a physical monitor and keyboard attached, if are using it over SSH it's not necessary because of the added network delay).&#xD;
You can get more details here: https://github.com/cyring/CoreFreq&#xD;
&#xD;
ATTENTION: If you experience any rendom crashes of Unraid or a crash when installing the plugin please make a short post in the support thread and also put you Diagnostics (Tools -> Diagnostics -> Download -> drop the downloaded zip file in the text box) in the post.&#xD;
&#xD;
WARNING: KEEP IN MIND, FREQUENCIES/CORE RATIOS ARE APPLIED IN REAL TIME, PLEASE ONLY CHANGE THE VALUES IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!</Description>
