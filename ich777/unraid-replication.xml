  <Description>This plugin allows you to replicate your main applications (Docker/LXC containers and chosen directories) to a second, unRAID based, Backup machine.  
With the inclusion of keepalived you can also create a virtual IP for your Main and Backup machine where the backup machine can automatically run the replicated containers.  
For more information visit the Support Thread on the forums.  
  
ATTENTION: This is a experimental release and it is recommended to use this tool with caution (make sure that you create a backup from your containers and data that is synced). If you encounter a bug please report it in the support thread.</Description>
